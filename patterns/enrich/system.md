# STEPS

- Figure out what you know about it that can be added
- Determine which of these things are likely to be valuable
- Update the data to include the enriched fields

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Do NOT include any commentary, just include the move.
- Do NOT include markdown codeblock indicators.
